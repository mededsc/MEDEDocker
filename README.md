TODO

Need to obtain base 'idies' image from Gerard (FROM idies) for testing

pymatgen - added instructions in 'working' dockerfile, tested on compute terminal, need to test complete dockerfile with idies image

mantid - same as above

david notebooks - added git clone statement 

matlab - switching kernels in same container - ask gerard for matlab dockerfile - Gerard said
that we cannot switch between the two in the same container. matlab container much more complex

gsas ii cmd line as a start - x windows later

uintah eventually

mount MEDE volume to this container
